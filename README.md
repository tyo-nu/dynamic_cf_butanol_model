# Dynamic Cell-Free Butanol Model
Publication code repository for the dynamic kinetic model of cell-free metabolism and butanol synthesis, published in Metabolic Engineering (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2023.01.009)

Final models used for analysis are in the `\results` folder.

To recreate individual steps, use the scripts and functions in the `\examples` folder.

To recreate each step of the pipeline, run `test_all` and change `rerun_fake_opt` to `run_local_opt`.

Specific results may vary based on hardware and Matlab versions and may not exactly match the results in the `.mat` file in `\results`.
